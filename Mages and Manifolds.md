# Beginning a Dungeon

Add the following to your inventory:
- Six [Rations](#ration-pack);
- Three [Laudanum](#laudanum);
- Two [Healing Salves](#healing-salve);
- One [Bandage](#bandages);
- One [Blessed Water](#blessed-water).

Draw 19 tiles from the Rune Deck and arrange them on the Rune board as labeled, in order. You may choose the rotation of each tile at will, apart from the *initial tiles* 11 and 17 (or if playing with 2 players, tiles 10, 12, and 17), whose transitions must not point off the board. If no rotation will facilitate this, redraw these tiles until this is possible.
```
         16   17   18
      14    6    7   19
    14    5    1    2    8
      13    4    3    9
         12   11   10
```
Roll a **D20** three times, and add the *Accepting* marker to the indicated tile. If the dice rolls 20, reroll two additional times.



# Combat

## Setup

1. Draw 7 *Mana cards* from the *Mana deck*. If you draw 4 or more of the same kind of Mana, you may choose to discard and redraw your Mana hand.
2. Draw 3 *Skill cards* from your *Combat deck*.
3. You must immediately channel at least 3 Mana into your *Casting Queue* at the start of each combat.
4. Place your *Spell Pointer* on tile 11, and the *Enemy Spell Pointer* on tile 17. If playing with 2 players, place player 1's Spell Pointers on tile 12, and Player 2's Spell Pointer on tile 10.
4. Reveal the enemy card and commence combat.


## Turn Phases

### Setup

- Remove leftover block from the previous turn.
- For each enemy, roll a D6 to determine [enemy actions](#enemy-actions) (if applicable).


### Draw

Draw *three* cards total from your Mana and Combat decks (you may divide your draws however you like). Non-specific modifiers to draw affect this number (some modifiers will specify Mana or Skill draw).

### Channelling
If playing with 2 players, take your turns simultaneously.

If your initial tile is unoccupied, you may add a new Spell Pointer there. Then, you may channel up to 3 Mana from your hand into any existing Casting Queue. The 3 Mana may be distributed between Queues at will.

### Casting

The following may be performed in any order.

- Select two unoccupied Rune tiles and change their rotations.

- For each Cast Speed, collect one Mana from the head of the Casting Queue into an *accumulation stack* and move the associated Spell Pointer along transitions accordingly. Perform these actions separately for each Spell Pointer.

  Spell Pointers cannot be partially resolved. That is, if your Cast Speed is 2, then you cannot move a Pointer one tile, play a Skill, then finish moving the Pointer after.



- You may play any Skill cards from your Hand. The Mana cost of a Skill must be *Consumed* from a single Casting Queue, and furthermore, the first available Mana from the top of the Casting Queue must be Consumed. For instance, if your Queue is:

       (Head) `[Fire - Ice - Lightning - Fire - Earth - Ice]` (Tail)
    and you play a Skill that requires 1 Fire and 1 Ice Mana, then you must take the newest Mana possible:

       (Head) `[Fire - Ice - Lightning - Earth]` (Tail)
   Consumed Mana is discarded and not accumulated.



### Resolution

If a Casting Queue is empty and the associated Spell Pointer is on an Accepting tile, the Spell is successfully *Resolved*.

Otherwise, the Spell [*Misfires*](#Misfires). If two Spell Pointers collides, both Spells Misfire.

Some special effects may also instantly Resolve Spells. Whenever this happens, all Queued Mana counts as Accumulated.

Spells deal damage as follows:
1. Count the Accumulated Mana and convert to damage as follows:

   |                  |        |
   | ---------------- | ------ |
   | Mana Accumulated | Damage |
   | 1                | 1      |
   | 2                | 2      |
   | 3                | 3      |
   | 4                | 5      |
   | 5                | 7      |
   | 6                | 10     |
   | 7                | 12     |
   | 8+               | 16     |

2. Deal this much damage as the type of the last Mana Accumulated (the *Primary Damage Type*);
3. Deal half as much damage (rounded down) as the type of the penultimate Mana Accumulated (the *Secondary Damage Type*).
4. If the Secondary Damage Type coincides with the Primary Damage Type, then deal double primary damage (instead of 1.5 times), gain four [*Stress*](#stress), and apply the associated elemental [Hazard](#Hazards) to your current tile.
5. If the Spell was a Misfire, halve the total damage.

Process [enemy defensive actions](#enemy-actions) before applying damage.

If a enemy card has requirements that may be met mid-cast, track them with a counter so you don't forget. Clear all counters whenever a Spell Resolves.


### Enemy Actions

After all Spells resolve and Skills have been played, enemies finally perform the listed action(s) on their card. (Defensive actions may be triggered earlier.)

The leftmost enemy acts first, before proceeding rightwards.

- Otherwise, the enemy takes the action corresponding to the number that the [dice rolled at the start of the turn](#setup-2).
- If an action does not have a listed number, it is activated every turn.
- If several unnumbered actions are listed, cycle through them each turn.

[Status cards](#status-effects) activate at the very end of the turn.



### Decay

Each combat has a *Decay Counter*, and some additionally have a *Decay effect*. If the turn counter is equal to the Decay Counter, activate the Decay effect at this point.

While Decay is active, gain 1 Stress every turn.





# Combat Mechanics

## Misfires

A **Player** Spell will *Misfire* if it:
- Resolves on a tile that is not Accepting;
- collides with any other Spell;
- takes a transition that leaves the board;
- takes a transition to an invalid state.

An **Enemy** Spell will Misfire if it:
- Resolves on a tile that is Accepting;
- collides with any other Spell.

(If an enemy Spell leaves the board or takes a transition to an invalid state, it successfully Resolves instead.)

Upon a Misfire, the caster takes half the damage of the Misfired Spell (rounded up) and gain one *Stress*.

## Damage Resistance and Vulnerability
Enemies and players take **half** damage (rounded up) from Resisted damage types, and **double** damage (rounded down) from Vulnerabilities.

[Resistance](#resistance) and [Vulnerability tokens](#vulnerable) apply the associated effect for **all** damage types.

If you are Vulnerable and Resistant to the same damage type, they cancel out and no damage multipliers are applied.

## Void Mana

Void Mana is a potent but dangerous type of Mana:
- Void Mana can take any transition.
- Mana further in the Casting Queue than a Void Mana cannot be consumed for Skills.
- Ending a turn on an accepting tile with a Void Mana channelled instantly causes a Misfire.  
- Misfires with a Void Mana channelled cause an additional Stress.
- Unless specified otherwise, all enemies are Vulnerable to Void damage.


## Accumulation
The process of collecting Mana from a Casting Queue into a Spell.

Distinct from *Consuming* Mana for Skills.

## Epsilon/Delta/Omega Transitions
An Epsilon transition allows a Spell Pointer to move to any tile without accumulating Mana.

A Delta transition allows a Spell Pointer to move to an adjacent tile without accumulating Mana.

An Omega transition allows a Spell Pointer to move to an adjacent tile, accumulating one Mana regardless of the type.


## Health
Whenever your Health total reaches zero or less each combat, gain **Death's Door** and increase your Stress to **18+X**, where **X** is the number of times your character has been on Death's Door this combat.

Taking any damage while on Death's Door will kill your character and end the expedition.

If your Health is healed back to a positive value, remove **Death's Door**.


If your Health total reaches zero, your character dies and the adventure ends.

## Block
- Temporary hitpoints that are removed at the end of each turn.
- Take damage from Block before Health.
- Void damage bypasses Block.

## Ward
- Temporary hitpoints that are removed at the end of combat.
- Take damage from Ward before Health.
- Void damage bypasses Ward.


## Stress

Upon accumulating 10 total Stress, your hero will be *tested* and gain a random *Stress effect*:
1.  Heal 4 Stress, ignore next instance of Stress.
2.  Heal 2 Stress, gain 1 Resistance.
3.  Heal 2 Health, gain 1 Phantasmal.
4.  You must play a Skill card each turn if you are able to. If unable, lose three Health.
5.  Channel three random mana from hand. If mana is not available, remove two Health for each mana deficit.
6.  Scorch three random Rune tiles and double cast speed for next turn.
7.  Flood two random Rune tiles and channel three Lightning mana.
8.  Shock two random Rune tiles and channel three Ice mana.
9.  Warp two random Rune tiles.
10. Exhaust your next Skill card.
11. Gain a random Curse.
12. Your next Spell will target a random ally instead. If the Spell Misfires, then hit all allies.

Stress effects that affect the Rune board will re-trigger every combat until Stress is reduced to 2 or lower.

Stress can continue to accumulate, and you will gain another random Stress effect for every 2 points of Stress past 10. Healing then regaining Stress does not give additional Stress effects until Stress has been completely cleared, e.g. if you have 2 Stress effects from having 12 Stress, then heal 4 Stress down to 8, you do not gain additional Stress effects from later reaching 10 or 12 Stress, as these are already considered active.

Reaching 20 points of Stress mid-combat will instantly kill your character.




## Hazards

#### Scorched (Fire):
If a Spell pointer *enters* a Scorched tile, the caster takes **6-X** Fire damage, where **X** is the number of channelled Ice Mana, and the Scorched Hazard spreads to the next tile the Spell Pointer moves to.

While on a Scorched tile, the caster becomes
- Vulnerable to Lightning damage.
- Resistant to Ice damage.

If a Ice transition is used to *leave* a Scorched tile, the Hazard is removed and does not spread.


#### Flooded (Ice):
Upon *entering* a Flooded tile, take **X** Lightning damage, where **X** is the number of channelled Lightning Mana. If a Lightning transition is used to *enter or exit* a Flooded tile, the Spell instantly Misfires.

While on a Flooded tile, the caster becomes:
- Vulnerable to Earth damage.
- Resistant to Fire damage.

If a Fire transition is used to *leave* a Flooded tile, the Hazard is removed.


#### Shocked (Lightning):
Upon *entering* a Shocked tile, take **2+X** Lightning damage, where **X** is the number of channelled Ice Mana, and channel two Fire mana.

While on a Shocked tile, the caster becomes:
- Vulnerable to Ice damage.
- Resistant to Earth damage.

If an Earth transition is used to *leave* a Shocked tile, the Hazard is removed.


#### Shattered (Earth):
If a Fire transition is used to *enter or exit* a Shattered tile, the Shatter Hazard spreads to all adjacent tiles and the caster takes **6** Earth damage.

While on a Shattered tile, the caster becomes:
- Vulnerable to all damage types.

If a Lightning transition is used to *leave* a Shattered tile, the Hazard is removed.


#### Warped (Void):
Upon *entering* a Warped tile, take **X** Void damage, where **X** is the number of channelled Mana.

While on a Warped tile, Damage Resistances and Vulnerability are inverted, and outbound Fire/Ice and Lightning/Earth transitions are swapped.

Finishing a turn on a Warped tile with a Void Mana channelled instantly causes a Misfire.

If Warp is applied to a tile with existing elemental Hazards, do not apply Warp and instead replace each Hazard on the tile with its opposite Hazard.


#### Infested:
Upon *entering* an Infested tile, remove the channeled Mana at the head of the Casting Queue. The Infestation spreads to the next tile the Spell Pointer moves to.

While on an Infested tile, Skills cost an additional generic Mana, and multi-target Skills may only target one enemy.

If a Fire transition is used to *leave* an Infested tile, the Hazard is removed from this tile, and spreads in the opposite direction instead.

(Infestation has no effect on enemies.)
